I have a .dat file in Unix server which has a single date in yyyy-mm-dd format.
i want to write a script in bash which will compare the date with the month end date of previous month(calendar month end date)
So if my script is invoked  today 29th August 2023 it will have to compare the date which is the file with 31st-July-2023 and give an oputput if the file date is greater or less than 31st-july-2023

#!/bin/bash

# Path to your .dat file --date from your filr
dat_file="/path/to/your/file.dat"

# Read the date from the .dat file
file_date=$(cat "$dat_file")

# Get the last day of the previous month
last_month_end=$(date -d "$(date +'%Y-%m-01') - 1 day" +'%Y-%m-%d')

# Compare the file date with the last day of the previous month
if [[ "$file_date" > "$last_month_end" ]]; then
  echo "File date ($file_date) is greater than the last day of the previous month ($last_month_end)"
elif [[ "$file_date" < "$last_month_end" ]]; then
  echo "File date ($file_date) is less than the last day of the previous month ($last_month_end)"
else
  echo "File date ($file_date) is the same as the last day of the previous month ($last_month_end)"
fi
